Reflect
I want to do interactions or commercial functions with payment interface and customer log in functions
I think I can handle the languages but I currently need more time to learn and keep balance with study time in school and I am expecting to have a good review for website design and the languages on spring break.
I can style div or p, within it set color to light salmon
inline style is used for each elements while internal allows you to clasify items and style it for further use.
it will change the header 1 style with font, background-color.
