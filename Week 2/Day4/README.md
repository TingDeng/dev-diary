Reflect
Depends on how simple it is, I can do a really simple one now and excited to see what I can make when I finish this course.
I get familiar with git and remember its pattern and eager to learn more and try to handle it better, learn from mistakes.
I find inserting img is interesting. I like color.

We first create files necessary and then git init and npm init to initialize and tell the system we are getting started, and then nmp install express --save, to install express and then go to atom to write code for html and server.js and use "git add " to add html and server.js that we have wrote and then use "git commit" to commit the changes. and go to webpage to see what we have created.
<a> allow us to add link to a img or a text and I like to use it.
<ul> is for unordered list <ol> is for ordered list.
