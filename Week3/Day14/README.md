Reflect:
I like code-along procedure, so I can practice since I don't have time to do much practice when I have classes and exams at school, but I am not sure if I understand the question correctly...
The greatest obstacle now I think is how to write the content in server.js and the more I know the more I can think of that I need to learn about. And still struggle when there comes the position issue, but I think data structure is hard and I am learning some with UCLA video classes, and I hope I can be better with it.
With java, I think I need to do more practice and memorizing the syntax. And I need to be more logical and be clear what I need to do if I want some result, more thinking and reflection....
Review:
var is variables and we need to do variable declaration first before we do anything else and build logic on these variables.
this aThing variable is declared to be a array and store three elements: a number, a string and a boolean value.
Types are: boolean, string,number and object
