Reflect:
1. The more we learn, the easier to figure out how to fix the code , so I guess it is a progress.
   It should be harder when we study a new language but at the same time it can be easier to understand and learn in a faster way. To some degree, I like mistakes which really helps me understand more things and learn more.
2. In a class, I think it is more important to catch up with the teacher's style rather than stick to the habit of one's own, or you will be frustrated and mess up with the tasks and confused, and even doubt yourself.
Review:
1. use addEventListener to create a function for mouseenter, and put behaviors of text font size inside the function.
2. create log in labels and a button on the page and functions for the inputs and button
3. in CSS styling page, adjust margin, position, width and height to the image.
