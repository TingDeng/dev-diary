Reflect
First class is interesting and overwhelming
I think I need to change a style and improve my listening
Review
sometimes it is hard for me to catch up with some terms
git status check status
git add add something
git commit confirm what you are doing
cd change directory
ls check info
mkdir create folder
touch create file
