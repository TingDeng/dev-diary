Reflect
I learn more from mistakes and I start to create new content on the webpage
<h7>the heading will be too small and hard to see
it is a blank page that you can write whatever you want
Review
h1,h3 are headings with different size, li is list, ul make a bullet list, ol list with numbers, span try to figure out, div means divide into groups em means emphasis, strong..same, p is paragraph
